# Air Pollution Prediction Project

This project involves building a predictive model for air pollution levels in urban areas. The model analyzes historical air quality and weather data to forecast concentrations of various pollutants, such as CO, NO, NO₂, O₃, SO₂, PM2.5, PM10, and NH₃. The project aims to aid smart cities in managing air quality, reducing pollution, and improving public health.

## Project Overview

Urban air pollution is a pressing issue that negatively impacts human health and the environment. This project leverages machine learning techniques to predict air pollutant levels based on historical data. The model is designed to provide actionable insights that city planners and environmental agencies can use to mitigate pollution risks.

The core objectives of this project include:

- Developing a time series model to predict air pollutant concentrations.
- Providing reliable forecasts that enable proactive measures for air quality management.
- Supporting smart city initiatives with data-driven environmental decision-making.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of hourly air quality measurements and meteorological data. Key attributes include:

- **CO**: Carbon Monoxide concentration
- **NO**: Nitric Oxide concentration
- **NO₂**: Nitrogen Dioxide concentration
- **O₃**: Ozone concentration
- **SO₂**: Sulfur Dioxide concentration
- **PM2.5**: Fine Particulate Matter (particles <2.5 micrometers)
- **PM10**: Coarse Particulate Matter (particles <10 micrometers)
- **NH₃**: Ammonia concentration
